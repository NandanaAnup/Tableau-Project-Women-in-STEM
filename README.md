# Tableau-Project-Women-in-STEM
# Objective
The objective of this dashboard is to provide comprehensive insights into women's representation across Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, analyzing gender gaps, identify trends in educational participation, and understand career progression patterns. By tracking metrics such as graduation rates, workforce representation, salary disparities, and historical trends from 2000-2015, the dashboard enables data-driven decisions for improving gender equality initiatives, optimizing educational programs, and maximizing women's participation in STEM careers.
# Steps Followed
1. Data Collection: The data was provided in the coursework.
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used Tableau to clean and standardize the dataset,ensuring consistency across different data sources and time periods.
3. Visualization Creation: Designed comprehensive visual components in Tableau, including trend lines, pie charts and bar graphs to showcase metrics like graduation trends over time, occupational distribution, educational attainment levels, and salary comparisons.

# Insights
1. Women in STEM Occupations
Distribution of women across four major STEM occupation categories, with Biological scientists representing 46% of female STEM professionals.
The visualization reveals that technology fields attract the most women in STEM, while traditional architechture and engineering disciplines show the lowest representation at 16.50%.

2. Percent of Women in STEM Jobs by Education
Women’s participation varies greatly by field and level of education. In health-related jobs, 25.19% of women hold master’s degrees and 19.45% have professional/doctoral degrees, highlighting stronger representation at advanced levels. In contrast, representation is far lower in technical fields. For example, only 9.07% of women in computers, 6.05% in engineering, and 7.70% in math jobs hold a bachelor’s degree.

3. Men and Women Working in Related Fields by Education
When comparing majors to actual job placement, men consistently outnumber women in technical careers. For instance, 53% of men with computer majors work in computer jobs, compared to 38% of women. Similarly, 30% of men with engineering majors transition into engineering jobs versus 24% of women. In health professions, however, women surpass men with 69% entering health-related jobs compared to 61% of men.This shows that women are more likely to follow through in healthcare than in technical fields where many do not continue into related careers.

4. Women in Computer Science and Engineering (2000–2015)
Over a 15-year period, the proportion of women graduating in technical fields has shown minimal improvement. In computer science, women’s graduation rate declined slightly and settled at 18.0% by 2015. In engineering, the share remained almost flat, ending at 20.1% in 2015. These stagnant figures suggest that despite efforts, systemic barriers have limited women’s entry and persistence in computer science and engineering fields.

5. Salaries of Men and Women by Ethnicity
Across all ethnic groups, men consistently earn higher salaries than women in STEM. Among Asians, men earn an average of $96,311, while women earn $81,011, a gap of $15,300. The disparity persists among Whites ($85,000 for men vs. $60,828 for women), Hispanics ($70,000 for men vs. $52,000 for women), and Blacks ($58,000 for men vs. $52,718 for women). These figures demonstrate that salary inequality is not only widespread but also particularly severe for Asian and White women, reinforcing that wage gaps remain a critical challenge even when women do enter STEM fields.

# Conclusion
The analysis reveals that Women in STEM remain unevenly represented, with 46.0% concentrated in health-related jobs but far fewer in technical fields such as mathematics (16.5%), physical sciences (25.2%), computer science (18.0% graduates by 2015), and engineering (20.1% graduates by 2015). Even when women major in technical subjects, fewer transition into related careers—for instance, only 38% of women with computer majors work in computer jobs compared to 53% of men—showing a clear “leaky pipeline.” Pay disparities also persist across all ethnicities, with Asian women earning $15,300 less than Asian men and White women earning $24,172 less than White men. These trends demonstrate that education alone is not enough to close the gender gap; structural changes in workplace practices, pay equity, and career progression are essential to help more women enter, persist, and thrive in STEM.
